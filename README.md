# Markov Name Generator

This program is used to generate realistic sounding names through a Markov stochastic process. Data is retrieved from input files containing names separated by syllables that are then processed into new words.

## Getting Started

To start using this project, download the .zip and extract it to any desired folder.

### Prerequisites

In order to use this project, you will need an input file containing text data separated by syllables for the program to process. A few sample input text files have already been provided for convenience. The format of the input should look similar to the following:

```
ice-land
in-di-a
in-do-ne-sia
i-ran
i-raq
ire-land
is-ra-el
i-ta-ly
i-vo-ry-coast
ja-mai-ca
ja-pan
jor-dan
```

## Running the program

Run name_generator.py in order to start the program. After doing so, the program will prompt the user to enter a file to read data from. Enter the path to the desired file and hit Enter.

The program will then prompt the user to enter the number of names to generate. Input the desired amount and press Enter again. A list of generated names will then be presented to the user.

Examples of generated names using the countries.txt input file:
```
Azagua
Vietzi
Kya
Pova
Miane
Sodare
Bincada
Hune
Ticia
Nedo
```
